  <title>Quantifiers in Proofs</title>

  <p> A <alert> mathematical statement </alert> is a phrase or sentence that can reasonably be called true or false. For convenience, they are sometimes assigned a letter like <m> P </m> or <m> Q </m> to make them easier to refer to. Consider the following mathematical statement.
  <me> P: \text{there exists a real number } x \text{ such that } x^2-x>0. </me>
  Is this statement true? If it is, we should be able to produce a number <m> x</m>, compute <m> x^2-x </m>, and verify that the quantity <m> x^2-x </m> is positive. The number <m> x=3 </m> has this property, along with many other real numbers. For shorthand notation, we will write <m> \exists </m> to mean ``there exists" and s.t. to mean ``such that". In shorthand, <m> P </m> becomes
  <me> P: \exists x\in \R \text{ s.t. } x^2-x>0, \text{ or equivalently} </me>
  <me> P: \exists x\in \R \text{ s.t. } x^2-x\in (0,\infty). </me>
  Here is our very first proof, a proof of <m> P </m>.     
  <proof> <cd>
  Let <m> x=3 </m>.
  We must show <m> x^2-x>0 </m>. 
  Since <m> x=3 </m>, we have <m> x^2-x=6</m>, and since <m> 6>0 </m>, we have <m> x^2-x>0 </m>. 
  </cd> </proof>

  The <alert> negation </alert> of a mathematical statement <m> P </m> is a new statment, which we will denote by 
  <m> \text{not} P </m>, whose truth value is opposite that of <m> P </m>. 
   A mathematical <alert> proof </alert> is a logical argument to convince the reader that a mathematical statement is true or false.

 <p> Consider the statement

  <p> This is a proof in a proof block. What does it look like? </p>
  <p> Trying out line break. </p>

        Suppose this were not the case.
        That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes.
        Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it <m>p</m>.
        Consider the number
        <me permid="JIL">
          N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="YhP">
        Now <m>N</m> is certainly larger than <m>p</m>.
        Also, <m>N</m> is not divisible by any number less than or equal to <m>p</m>,
        since every number less than or equal to <m>p</m> divides <m>p!</m>.
        Thus the prime factorization of <m>N</m> contains prime numbers
        (possibly just <m>N</m> itself)
        all greater than <m>p</m>.
        So <m>p</m> is not the largest prime, a contradiction.
        Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
