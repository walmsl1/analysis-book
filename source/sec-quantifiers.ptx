  <title>Quantifiers in Proofs</title>

  <p> A <alert> mathematical statement </alert> is a phrase or sentence that can reasonably be called true or false. 
  The <alert> negation </alert> of a mathematical statement <m> P </m> is a new statment, which we will denote by 
  <m> \text{not} P </m>, whose truth value is opposite that of <m> P </m>. 
   A mathematical <alert> proof </alert> is a logical argument to convince the reader that a mathematical statement is true or false. 
  </p>

 <proof>
  <p> This is a proof in a proof block. What does it look like? </p>
  <p> Trying out line break. </p>
  <p> To see if it works. </p>

      <p permid="saG">
        Suppose this were not the case.
        That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes.
        Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it <m>p</m>.
        Consider the number
        <me permid="JIL">
          N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="YhP">
        Now <m>N</m> is certainly larger than <m>p</m>.
        Also, <m>N</m> is not divisible by any number less than or equal to <m>p</m>,
        since every number less than or equal to <m>p</m> divides <m>p!</m>.
        Thus the prime factorization of <m>N</m> contains prime numbers
        (possibly just <m>N</m> itself)
        all greater than <m>p</m>.
        So <m>p</m> is not the largest prime, a contradiction.
        Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
      </p>
