  <title>Quantifiers in Proofs</title>

  <p> A <alert> mathematical statement </alert> is a phrase or sentence that can reasonably be called true or false. For convenience, they are sometimes assigned a letter like <m> P </m> or <m> Q </m> to make them easier to refer to. Consider the following mathematical statement.
  <me> P: \text{there exists a real number } x \text{ such that } x^2-x>0. </me>
  Is this statement true? If it is, we should be able to produce a number <m> x</m>, compute <m> x^2-x </m>, and verify that the quantity <m> x^2-x </m> is positive. The number <m> x=3 </m> has this property, along with many other real numbers. For shorthand notation, we will write <m> \exists </m> to mean ``there exists" and s.t. to mean ``such that". In shorthand, <m> P </m> becomes
  <me> P: \exists x\in \R \text{ s.t. } x^2-x>0, </me>
  or equivalently,
  <me> P: \exists x\in \R \text{ s.t. } x^2-x\in (0,\infty). </me>
  Now that we are convinced <m> P </m> is true, let's see our very first proof.     
  <proof>
  Let <m> x=3 </m>.
  We must show <m> x^2-x>0 </m>. 
  Since <m> x=3 </m>, we have <m> x^2-x=6>0</m>, as desired. 
   </proof>

  While this proof might seem like too much trouble, we will reap many benefits by developing some general proof principles in simple situations. First, we will use the overall structure of this existence proof for  almost every existence argument in this class. It is worth writing down a general ``proof outline" of an existence argument.

        To prove: <m> \exists x \in \mathcal{S} </m> s.t. this thing about <m> x</m> happens.A <term>tree</term> is a connected graph containing no cycles.<fn>
        Sometimes this is stated as <q>a tree is an acyclic connected graph;</q> <q>acyclic</q>
        is just a fancy word for <q>containing no cycles.</q>
        </fn>
      </p>
  
  There are a few things to take away from this proof. 
  The <alert> negation </alert> of a mathematical statement <m> P </m> is a new statment, which we will denote by 
  <m> \text{not} P </m>, whose truth value is opposite that of <m> P </m>. 
   A mathematical <alert> proof </alert> is a logical argument to convince the reader that a mathematical statement is true or false.

 <p> Consider the statement

 <proof>
  <p> This is a proof in a proof block. What does it look like? </p>
  <p> Trying out line break. </p>

      <p permid="saG">
        Suppose this were not the case.
        That is, suppose there are only finitely many primes.
        Then there must be a last, largest prime, call it <m>p</m>.
        Consider the number
        <me permid="JIL">
          N = p! + 1 = (p \cdot (p-1) \cdot \cdots 3\cdot 2 \cdot 1) + 1
        </me>.
      </p>

      <p permid="YhP">
        Now <m>N</m> is certainly larger than <m>p</m>.
        Also, <m>N</m> is not divisible by any number less than or equal to <m>p</m>,
        since every number less than or equal to <m>p</m> divides <m>p!</m>.
        Thus the prime factorization of <m>N</m> contains prime numbers
        (possibly just <m>N</m> itself)
        all greater than <m>p</m>.
        So <m>p</m> is not the largest prime, a contradiction.
        Therefore there are infinitely many primes.
      </p>
