    Geometrically, a definite integral represents the area <m>A</m> between a curve <m>f</m> and the horizontal axis over an interval <m>[a,b]</m>.

<p>
To underestimate the area <m>A</m>, we place rectangles below the curve by first creating a <alert>partition</alert> 
<m>P</m> of the interval <m>[a,b]</m> as <m>P=\{a=t_0 \lt t_1 \lt \cdots \lt t_n=b\}</m>. Each subinterval <m>[t_{i-1}, t_i]</m> on the horizontal axis serves as the base of a rectangle, and to produce a rectangle below the curve, we take <m>\inf\{f(x): x\in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\}</m> to be the rectangles height. If instead we take <m>\sup \{f(x): x\in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\}</m>, we get a rectangle above the curve over that subinterval.

Adding up the areas of each lower rectangle gives us a <alert> lower sum </alert> over the partition <m>P</m>, which we denote by <m>L(f,P)</m>.

<me>L(f,P) =\sum_{i=1}^n \inf\{f(x): x\in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\} (t_i-t_{i-1}).</me>

Any lower sum is an underestimate of the true area <m>A</m>, so the supremum of all possible lower estimates gives us a sort of "best underestimate" of <m>A</m>, and we call it the <alert>lower integral</alert> of <m>f</m> over <m>[a,b]</m>:

<me> L(f)=\sup\{L(f,P): P \text{ is any partition of } [a,b]\}. </me>

Whatever the area <m>A</m> is, the geometric intuition is that
<me>L(f)\leq A.</me>
Similarly, the <alert>upper sum</alert> over <m>P</m> is given by

<me> U(f,P) =\sum_{i=1}^n \sup\{f(x): x\in [t_{i-1}, t_i]\} (t_i-t_{i-1}),</me>

and the infimum over all possible upper sums gives us a ``best overestimate" of <m>A</m>, called the <alert>upper integral</alert> of <m>f</m> over <m>[a,b]</m>:

<me>U(f)=\inf\{U(f,P): P \text{ is any partition of } [a,b]\}.</me>

Geometrically, we suspect <m>A\leq U(f)</m>, and so we should have <m>L(f)\leq A \leq U(f)</m>. When <m>L(f)=U(f)</m>, we say that <m>f</m> is <alert>integrable</alert> over <m>[a,b]</m>, and we define its area under the curve as <m>L(f)</m> (or <m>U(f)</m>, since they are equal), and we write
<me>\int f =\int_a^b f(x)\, dx = L(f)=U(f).</me>
You may find it surprising that there are functions <m>f</m> for which <m>L(f) \lt U(f)</m>, which is to say not every function is integrable. But fear not; we will show that every continuous function is integrable, ensuring that everything you did in Calculus was not for naught!

It is worth checking that <m>L(f)</m> is in fact no greater than <m>U(f)</m>, and this fact follows from checking several details which themselves follow from our groundwork in sups and infs. We will leave the details of the following facts to the exercises.
\begin{itemize}
    \item If <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> are partitions of <m>[a,b]</m> and <m>P\subseteq Q</m>, then
    <m>L(f,P)\leq L(f,Q)\leq U(f,Q)\leq U(f,P)</m>.
    \item For any partitions <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> of <m>[a,b]</m>, <m>L(f,P)\leq U(f,Q)</m>.
    \item <m>L(f)\leq U(f)</m>.
\end{itemize}

The definition of being integrable was built upon intuitive geometric principles, but it is not the most practical definition to check; it requires computing both <m>L(f)</m> and <m>U(f)</m> exactly, which is typically a formidable task even for relatively tame functions, as we will see. Luckily, there is an easier to check <m>\epsilon</m>-criterion at our disposal.

<theorem>
        <statement>
            <p>
                A function <m>f</m> is integrable on <m>[a,b]</m> if and only if for all <m>\epsilon>0</m>, there exists a partition <m>P</m> such that <m>U(f,P)-L(f,P) \lt \epsilon</m>.
            </p>
        </statement>
    </theorem>

Let's put this theorem in action to see why discontinuous functions can still be integrable.
