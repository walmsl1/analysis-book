                First we should check that these sequences really are arithmetic by taking differences of successive terms.
                Doing so will reveal the common difference <m>d</m>.

                        <m>5-2 = 3</m>, <m>8-5 = 3</m>, etc.
                        To get from each term to the next,
                        we add three, so <m>d = 3</m>.
                        The recursive definition is therefore <m>a_n = a_{n-1} + 3</m> with <m>a_0 = 2</m>.
                        The closed formula is <m>a_n = 2 + 3n</m>.

                        Here the common difference is <m>-7</m>,
                        since we add <m>-7</m> to 50 to get 43, and so on.
                        Thus we have a recursive definition of
                        <m>a_n = a_{n-1} - 7</m> with <m>a_0 = 50</m>.
                        The closed formula is <m>a_n = 50 - 7n</m>.

        <title>A Sample Aside</title>
        <p>
            Here is some text inside a sample aside.
            I'm going to put the Pythagorean identity below:
            <me>
            \sin^2(x) + \cos^2(x) = 1
            </me>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This aside has two paragraphs.
            You can't do that with a footnote.
        </p>

    <proof>
        <p>
        Let <m>P(n)</m> be the statement,
        <q><m>n</m> is either prime or can be written as the product of primes.</q>
        We will prove <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Base case: <m>P(2)</m> is true because <m>2</m> is indeed prime.
        </p>

        <p>
        Inductive case: assume <m>P(k)</m> is true for all <m>k \lt n</m>.
        We want to show that <m>P(n)</m> is true.
        That is, we want to show that <m>n</m> is either prime or is the product of primes.
        If <m>n</m> is prime, we are done.
        If not, then <m>n</m> has more than 2 divisors,
        so we can write <m>n = m_1 \cdot m_2</m>,
        with <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> less than <m>n</m>
        (and greater than 1).
        By the inductive hypothesis,
        <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> are each either prime or can be written as the product of primes.
        In either case,
        we have that <m>n</m> is written as the product of primes.
        </p>

        <p>
        Thus by the strong induction,
        <m>P(n)</m> is true for all <m>n \ge 2</m>.
        </p>
    </proof>
