## Compilation instructions

This text is written in [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org), so the primary source files can be found in the `source` directory.  These can be compiled into HTML or PDF files (as well as some other formats) using the following directions.

### Preliminaries

The easiest way to build output formats from the source is to use the PreTeXt-CLI.  To get this set up, follow the instructions in the [PreTeXt guide](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/quickstart-getting-pretext.html).  You will need Python, LaTeX, and `pdf2svg` (if you wish to compile the html version; this requires an [extra step](https://pretextbook.org/doc/guide/html/section-installing-pdf2svg.html) on Windows).

Open up a terminal and in your preferred directory, clone `analysis-book` repositories:

`git clone https://github.com/walmsl1/analysis-book.git`

(If you had previously done this, you will likely want to get the most recent versions of the repository by entering `git pull` from the analysis-book folder.)

Then change to the `analysis-book` folder:

`cd analysis-book`

### Compiling

If everything has been set up properly above, you can now execute the following commands to build the book.  To create a PDF, you can enter:

`pretext build pdf -w`

To make the HTML version:

`pretext build html -w -d`

The `-w` and `-d` flags are only needed the first time you compile, to extract the WeBWorK exercises and create SVGs for the images.  Use the flags again only if you edit these elements in the source.
